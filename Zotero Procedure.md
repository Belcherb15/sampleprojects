# Adding Items to Zotero

This page describes the various ways to add items to your Zotero library.

_Items_ in Zotero are the bibliographic entries about books, journal articles, webpages (etc.) that you can add to your library. You can further organize these items into collections (based on topic, use, etc.) and add tags, notes, and files to your items as well.

To get started adding items to your Zotero library, see the [Table of Tasks](#tabletasks).

If you are new to Zotero, here are some links to help you install and get started before you add items to your library.

### Adding Items Via Web Browser <a name="itemsbybrowser"></a>
You can easily add items to your Zotero library from your web browser.

The Zotero Connector save button allows you to browse for items online and then add those items with their bibliographic information to your Zotero library.

Here are the steps to use the save button:

1. Install the Zotero Connector browser extension and the Zotero desktop app on your device. To download these, visit the [Downloads](https://www.zotero.org/download/) page.

    * _**Caution**: Open and run the Zotero desktop app when you are utilizing the Zotero Connector browser extension. If your Zotero desktop app is not running when you click the save button, you will receive an error message asking you to open the desktop app._


2. Look up the item you would like to add to your Zotero library.
3. Click on the Zotero Connector save button icon.

    * Depending  on item type, you may see a book icon <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cw6QbBt.png?1" alt="Figure 1" width="20" height="whatever">, a journal article icon <img src="https://i.imgur.com/40icTvm.png?1" alt="Figure 1" width="20" height="whatever"> , or other icons. If you click one of these icons, a separate window will appear, and you can use the drop-down menu to specify where you would like to save your item. Click the `v` to expand the window and add any tags to your item. When you are finished, click `Done`. Your item will now be added to the place you specified in your library.

    * If you see a folder icon <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Etk3Gzd.png?1" alt="Figure 1" width="25" height="whatever">, there are multiple items on the page that you can save to Zotero. When you click the folder icon, you can click on each item you want to save in your library. When you are finished selecting items, click `Ok` to add them to your library.

    * _Note: For a video walkthrough of how to add single and multiple items to Zotero as described in this section, see [Adding Items to Zotero: Using the Browser Extension Save Button](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU_YMjuqEMo)_

    * _Note: Some specific types of items, like PDFs and Webpages, may require more steps to save them to the library. For more information about these cases, see [Adding PDFs and Other Files](#pdfsandfiles) or [Adding Webpages](#webpagess)._

### Adding Items By Identifier <a name="itemsbyidentifier"></a>
You can add items to your Zotero library by using the item identifier.

Here are the steps to use the Add Item by Identifier Button:

1. Open your desktop Zotero app and locate the Add Item by Identifier button on the upper panel (_Figure 1_).

     <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KFp0M4m.png" alt="Figure 1" width="350" height="whatever">.

     _Figure 1: Add Item by Identifier button_

2. Click on the button and enter the item's ISBN, DOI, or other identifying number into the available box.

3. Click `Enter` or `Return` to add the item to your Zotero library.

    * To enter multiple identifiers at one time, type the first identifier, then press `Shift+Enter`/`Return`. Then, type in the remaining identifiers (one on each line). Once you've typed all the identifiers, press `Shift+Enter`/`Return` to import all the items at once. You can also paste a list of multiple identifiers (each on a separate line), then press `Shift+Enter`/`Return` to finish.

    * _Note: Zotero uses the following databases for looking at item metadata:_

      * _For ISBNs: [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/) and [WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org/)_
      * _For DOIs: [CrossRef](https://www.crossref.org/)_
      * _For PubMedIDs: [NCBI PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)_

### Adding PDFs and Other Files <a name="pdfsandfiles"></a>
You can add a PDF to your library as an item or attach a PDF to an existing item.

Here are some different methods and considerations for adding PDFs and other files:    

* Add your PDF to your library with the Zotero Connector save button. (See [Adding Items Via Web Browser](#itemsbybrowser)).

    * If you are viewing a PDF file in your browser, the save button will show a PDF icon <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6SfbNLF.png" alt="Figure 1" width="20" height="whatever">. When you click this button, Zotero will automatically attempt to extract bibliographic information from the PDF.

    * _Note: Zotero is often able to successfully extract bibliographic information from PDFs and add it to the item entry in the library. However, it is still recommended to use the Zotero save button  from the publication's abstract page or catalog entry (rather than the PDF) when possible._


* Drag and drop the PDF or other file into your Zotero library.

    * If you drag the file to an existing item in your library, Zotero will add the new file to that item. If you want the PDF or file listed as an independent item, drag and drop it in between your existing library items.

    * _Note: If you drag and drop your PDF or file into your library, Zotero will automatically attempt to retrieve bibliographic metadata for the file, though in some cases this may yield lower quality metadata than importing using the Save to Zotero button from your browser._

*  Add the PDF by [using the item identifier add button](#itemsbyidentifier) or by [adding the file manually](#itemsmanually).

* Add PDFs or other files by clicking the green plus sign (<img src="https://www.zotero.org/support/_media/add.png" alt="Figure 1" width="" height="whatever">) in the Zotero toolbar and choosing `Store Copy of File` or `Link to File`.

  * Using this method will store the link or copy of the PDF (or other file) in your library without listing it as an official item. Additionally, if you already have an item listed in your library with the same bibliographic data as the PDF, Zotero will automatically add the PDF to that item when you use this method.


* Add a PDF or other file as an attachment to an existing Zotero item by selecting the existing item and then clicking the `Add Attachment` button (paperclip icon-shown below in _Figure 2_). You can then specify if you want to add a link to the URI, a stored copy of the file, or a link to the file.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/c2MOLz6.png" alt="Figure 2" width="275" height="whatever">.

  _Figure 2: Add Attachment button in Zotero and dropdown menu of options_

    * You can also add an attachment to an item by right-clicking on the item and then selecting the `Add Attachment` button.





<p>&nbsp;</p>


### Adding Webpages <a name="webpagess"></a>

You can add a webpage and its bibliographic information to your Zotero library.

Here are some methods and considerations for adding a webpage to your library:

* Use the Zotero Connector save button to add the webpage to your library (See [Adding Items Via Web Browser](#itemsbybrowser)).

    * If you are viewing a webpage in your browser, the Zotero Connector save button will show a webpage icon <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Ot7rtFy.png" alt="Figure 1" width="20" height="whatever">.

    * _Note: If the webpage icon is blue, the webpage is recognized by a translator and can extract bibliographic metadata from the website. A blue icon means that you have three saving options: embedded metadata (available bibliographic information), web page with snapshot (or copy), or webpage without snapshot (Figure 3). If the webpage isn't recognized by a translator, the webpage icon will be gray. You can still save the webpage to your library, but only the last two save options (Web Page with Snapshot or Web Page Without Snapshot) will be available._

    * If you click the webpage save icon, the webpage will be saved to your Zotero library. If you want to specify the way to save the webpage, right-click on the save button and then select `Save to Zotero` to specify how to save the webpage in your library (_Figure 3_).

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/l1haEQi.png" alt="Figure 3" width="425" height="whatever">

        _Figure 3: Options for saving a webpage in your Zotero library_

    * _Note: Go to your Zotero Preferences (`Edit`> `Preferences` > `General`) and make sure the statement “Automatically take snapshots when creating items from web pages” is enabled. With this enabled, when you save a webpage to Zotero using the save button, a snapshot (or copy) of the webpage will automatically be saved as well. Right-click on the saved webpage in your Zotero library to view the snapshot (Figure 4)_

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/KjdxgYv.png?1" alt="Figure 4" width="250" height="whatever">  

      _Figure 4: Saved webpage and corresponding webpage snapshot in your Zotero library_

    * _Note: If you double-click a saved webpage item without a snapshot, you will be directed to the original webpage. If you double-click a saved webpage with a snapshot, you will be directed to the snapshot. You can also visit the original webpage by going to the listed webpage information ("Info") and clicking the `URL` label._

### Importing Items from Other Tools <a name="importingtools"></a>

You can import items into your Zotero library from other reference management systems or databases.

**_Importing Items from Another Reference Management System_**

You can import your library items from other reference management systems, such as Endnote, Reference Manager, Citavi, RefWorks, Mendeley, and others.

Here are the steps to import your library from another reference system:

1. Export the bibliographic data from your other reference management program.

2. Go to Import (`File`>`Import`) in Zotero.

3. Browse for the file you want to import, select it, and click `Open`. This will import the items into your Zotero library in a date-stamped collection.

    * _Note: Regardless of what other reference management system you are using, the steps to import items to Zotero are generally standardized. However, here are some detailed instructions to help you import items from several common reference management systems:_

      * [_Importing Items from Mendeley_](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/mendeley_import)
      * [_Importing Items from EndNote_](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/endnote_import)
      * [_Importing Items from Citavi_](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/import-from-citavi)  
        <p></p>
    * _Note: Here is the complete list of the bibliographic formats that Zotero can import: [Importing Standardized Formats](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/importing_standardized_formats)_

    * _**Caution**: The import/export method is not generally recommended for transferring entire Zotero libraries between different computers or Zotero installations as information can be lost in the transfer. See [Transferring a Library](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/transferring_a_library) for more detailed information and instructions._

    * _Note: Bibliographic data stored in Microsoft Word documents (using Word's bibliography feature) cannot be imported to Zotero using the import/export method. For another way to import Microsoft Word bibliographic data, see [Citations inserted using Microsoft Word's built-in citation feature](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/importing_formatted_bibliographies)._

    * _Note: Use the [Reference Extractor](https://rintze.zelle.me/ref-extractor/) tool to extract and import embedded Zotero or Mendeley citations from Microsoft Word._


_**Importing Items from a Database**_

You can import items to your Zotero library from scholarly databases like Google Scholar, ProQuest, and Web of Science.

Here are a few methods you can use to import items:

* You can [use the Zotero save button](itemsbybrowser) to import items from databases into your Zotero library.

  * _**Caution**: Some databases may lock you out if you use the Zotero save button too frequently or if you try to import too many items at once (ex: such as if you are conducting a systematic review). To avoid this problem, follow the step in #2 below._


*  Export the items as a batch using one of the [standardized formats](https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/importing_standardized_formats) and then import the files into Zotero.

    * _Note: Web of Science and ProQuest offer the ability to select multiple items from a search results list and export them as a batch to various formats. In Google Scholar, you need to first save the items to your Google Scholar library (using the ☆ icon in the search results), then select and export them from the Google Scholar “My Library” page._



<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Adding Items Manually <a name="itemsmanually"></a>

You can add items manually to your online or desktop Zotero library as well.

Here are the steps to add an item manually:

1. Open up your library and click the "New Item" button on the top pane.
    * The new item button for the Zotero desktop app is <img src="https://www.zotero.org/support/_media/add.png" alt="Figure 1" width="15" height="whatever">.
    * The new item button for the online Zotero site is `+`.


2. Select the desired item type from the drop-down menu. When you click on an item type, a blank entry form for that item type will open.
    * The items that appear in the initial drop-down menu are your most recently created item types. If you would like to see more available item types, select `More` in the drop-down list (_Figure 5_). Note that _Figure 5_ only shows the first few item types in the "More" dropdown list, and there are many more item types available.

      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/0teU4is.png" alt="Figure 3" width="250" height="whatever">

      _Figure 5: New Item button and item type selection drop-down menu_

3. Fill in the bibliographic information for your item in the entry form.

    * _Note: The best way to save a webpage to your Zotero library is by using the Zotero save button in your browser (see [Adding Webpages](webpagess)). Because of this, the webpage item type does not appear in the “New Item” menu. If you want to manually add a webpage, select any other item type and then switch the item type to Webpage. (Ex: Click `New Item`>`Book`, then in the entry form by "Item Type" click `Book` and select `Web Page` from the bottom of the drop-down menu)._
