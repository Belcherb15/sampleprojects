# Sample Technical Writing Projects
This repo showcases some of the technical writing work I have done. Brief project descriptions are available below: 

1. **Zotero Procedure**: I completed this project for a master's-level Advanced Technical Writing and Editing class at North Carolina State University. I reviewed the Zotero procedure documentation about "Adding Items" on the Zotero website and rewrote and restructured this procedure to better meet user needs. I wrote in markdown and used Atom and Github in the process of writing this procedure document.
